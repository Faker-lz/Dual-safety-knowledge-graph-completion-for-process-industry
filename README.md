# Dual-safety knowledge graph completion for process industry

The dataset and code program of the paper "Dual-safety knowledge graph completion for process industry".

The experiments base NueralKG , so before you conduct the experiments you should read the [NueralKG documents](zjukg/NeuralKG: [Tool\] For Knowledge Graph Representation Learning (github.com)](https://github.com/zjukg/NeuralKG#----an-open-source-library-for-diverse-representation-learning-of-knowledge-graphs) and install it. And the scripts are in the `./scripts` directory.

Our desensitized data is in `./dataset`directory.
